    <b> The Pyrustic Ecosystem </b>
    </p>
</div>


`Python` is one of the world's most [popular](https://www.wired.com/story/python-language-more-popular-than-ever/) programming languages. There are some great frameworks for building web application with Python. Pyrustic targets Python desktop application development.

Since a framework alone isn't enough, `Pyrustic` comes with batteries included, just like the Python language itself which comes with an amazing standard library. Pyrustic is shipped with a powerful command-line tool: `The Manager`. The Manager allows you to create a new project with the standard structure, initialize a project directory, build a distribution package, publish the distribution package, and more.

Pyrustic is flexible enough that you can use only one of its components. For example, you can decide to only use the `Table` widget from the `pyrustic.widget` package in your existing `Tkinter` codebase. Another example is to only use Pyrustic to build a [Wheel](https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/story.html) and then publish it for your users to consume through [Hubstore](https://github.com/pyrustic/hubstore).

Pyrustic is useful for a new project as well as for an existing project.


# The Framework
The Framework covers various topics, from GUI to database connection, and more.

## Standard Project Structure
The `Framework` is easy to use and flexible with only three constraints:
- you have to follow the conventional Python project structure as described in the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/);
- you need to have a `__main__.py` file in the source package;
- the project name should be the same as the source package (*).

In fact, these constraints are just good practice and guess what, the command-line tool [Manager](#the-manager) will take care of these details for you, you will just need to link a project directory, then issue the command `init`.

(*) If you are wondering how to deal with the hyphen versus underscore issue in a project structure, take a look at [tk-cyberpunk-theme](https://github.com/pyrustic/tk-cyberpunk-theme). In short, use a hyphen in the distribution package name and use an underscore in the import package name.


## GUI
Pyrustic proudly uses `Tkinter` as `GUI Toolkit`. Why [Tkinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) ? Read this [answer](https://github.com/pyrustic/pyrustic/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#why-tkinter--isnt-that-a-bad-bet-).

Some features related to the GUI:
- The `Framework` comes with many awesome widgets (mega-widgets to be precise): `Table`, `Scrollbox`, `Toast`, `Tree` and more.
- `pyrustic.default_style` and `pyrustic.theme.Theme`: a style/theme mechanism to make it easy for you to build beautiful GUIs.
- `tk_cyberpunk_theme`: a dark theme ready to use.
- `pyrustic.view.View`: Pyrustic comes with the concept of `views`. `Views` are optional to use and are compatible with Tkinter. In fact, Views provides an intuitive lifecycle mechanism that will make it easier to build and maintain your GUI.
- and more...

### Example of typical `__main__.py` content

The following is an excerpt from the demo. Explore the [demo project](https://github.com/pyrustic/demo).

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand (or collapse)</summary>

```python
from pyrustic.app import App
from tk_cyberpunk_theme.main import Cyberpunk
from demo.view.main_view import MainView


def main():
    # The App
    app = App(__package__)
    # Set theme
    app.theme = Cyberpunk()
    # Set view
    app.view = MainView(app)  # it could be a Tkinter object
    # Center the window
    app.center()
    # Lift off !
    app.start()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

</details>


## Multithreading
It is well known how difficult it is to implement multithreading in a Tkinter application. Pyrustic comes with `pyrustic.threadom`: a `library` to make it easy to develop multithreading applications. You can retrieve from the main thread the values returned by the functions executed in other threads and also the exceptions raised by these functions.

[Jupitest](https://github.com/pyrustic/jupitest) the graphical `Test Runner` makes extensive use of the `pyrustic.threadom` library to perform smooth real-time test reporting.

## Fetching Resources
Pyrustic comes with `pyrustic.gurl`: a `library` to fetch resources with an implementation of [conditional request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests) and a smart responses caching system.

[Hubway](https://github.com/pyrustic/hubway) the app to publish application, uses this library to fetch resources as a good API citizen.

## Communicating Between Components And Event Notification
As a software grows, so is its complexity. Pyrustic comes with `pyrustic.com` a library to allow loosely coupled components to exchange data, subscribe to and publish events.

Please read the [tutorial](#tutorial) to get a deep understanding of this section.


## Database Access Object
Pyrustic comes with `pyrustic.dao`: a `library` to simplify the connection to your [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.
This library has some cool features like the ability to specify what I call a `creational script` that will be used to create a new database when it is missing.

## And More
- `pyrustic.jasonix`: a `library` included in the `Framework` which makes it so cool to work with `JSON` files. `Pyrustic` uses extensively this `library` to store user preferences, configuration data and more. With this `library`, you can initialize preferences/configuration/whatever files easily, thanks to the internal mechanism of `Jasonix` that creates a fresh copy of the given default `JSON` file at the target path. `Jasonix` also comes with a lock to open [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files in readonly mode.
- for obvious reasons (clue: `beta`), `Pyrustic` does not take the risk of deleting the files it needs to get rid of, instead it moves them to a `trash` folder.
- and more...

# The Manager
<!-- Image -->
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrustic/misc/master/media/manager.gif" alt="Manager" width="650">
    <p align="center">
    <b> Manager </b>
    </p>
</div>

The `Manager` is a command-line application with an API that you can use to automate your workflow.

Via the `Manager` you can:
- create a project with battery included (project structure, pyproject.toml, default README.md, etc);
- easily add multiples `packages`, `modules` or `files` to your project with a one line command;
- run a specific `module` or `package` of your project;
- run any package previously installed with `pip`, in others words, you just need to type `run jupitest` to open the graphical test runner `Jupitest`;  
- view recent projects list and quickly switch between projects;
- build a distribution package according to setup.cfg and MANIFEST.in;
- publish your application (distribution package);  
- find out if the project is installed ('pip install -e') in the current virtual env;  
- and more...

Type `help` in the Manager to discover the commands. Basically, you will often need to use the command `link` or `relink` to link a project to the Manager, `init` to initialize your project, `run` to run your project, `build` to build a distribution package and `publish` to publish your app.

You need a personal access token to publish your application. It is easy to generate a personal access token. Read this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).


# Some Desktop Apps Built With Pyrustic
The following apps are made with Pyrustic:
- `Rustiql`: a graphical `SQL Editor`;
- `Jupitest`: a graphical `Test Runner`;
- `Jupitest`: a graphical `Test Runner`;
- `Hubway`: an application to publish your project;
- `Hubstore`: an application to connect your apps with your users. 

Their themes are based on [tk-cyberpunk-theme](https://github.com/pyrustic/tk-cyberpunk-theme).

## Rustiql - The Graphical SQL Editor
<!-- Image -->
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrustic/misc/master/media/rustiql.gif" alt="SQL Editor" width="650">
    <p align="center">
    <b> SQL Editor </b>
    </p>
</div>

The graphical `SQL Editor` allows you to:
- visualize your databases content;
- edit your database (CRUD);
- import SQL scripts;
- open in-memory database;
- and more...

Install `Rustiql`:
```bash
pip install rustiql
```

The `SQL Editor` makes extensive use of the `pyrustic.dao` library.



## Jupitest - The Graphical Test Runner
<!-- Image -->
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrustic/misc/master/media/jupitest.gif" alt="Test Runner" width="650">
    <p align="center">
    <b> Test Runner </b>
    </p>
</div>

The `Test Runner` reproduces the tree structure of the `tests` folder in your project. The `Test Runner` allows you to:
- run test `packages`;
- run test `modules`;
- run test `classes`;
- and even run test `methods`;
- and more...

Install `Jupitest`:
```bash
pip install jupitest
```


The `Test Runner` makes extensive use of the `pyrustic.threadom` library to perform smooth real-time test reporting.



## Hubway - Release Your App To The World
<!-- Image -->
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrustic/misc/master/media/hubway.gif" alt="Hubway" width="650">
    <p align="center">
    <b> Hubway </b>
    </p>
</div>

`Hubway` is an application that allows you to publish a new release of your application on `Github`. Once published, you can track your project, see metrics like the number of `stargazers`, `subscribers` or releases `downloads`.


Install `Hubway`:
```bash
pip install hubway
```


`Hubway` makes extensive use of `pyrustic.gurl` to fetch resources.

You need a personal access token to publish a release via `Hubway` or to increase the API rate limit.
It is easy to generate a personal access token. Read this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).



## Hubstore - To Connect Apps With Users
<!-- Image -->
<div align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrustic/misc/master/media/hubstore_cover.png" alt="Hubstore" width="650">
    <p align="center">
    <b> Hubstore </b>
    </p>
</div>

Once you have published your app to Github with the command `publish`, the next question that arises is: "How to make the `find-download-install-run` process easier for users?". This is where the `Hubstore` comes in.

With `Hubstore`, it's easy to showcase, distribute, install, and manage your Python desktop apps.

Note that any Python Wheel app is compatible with `Hubstore`, in others words, you don't need to use the `Pyrustic` Framework to have a `Hubstore` compatible app.

`Hubstore` is available on PyPI.

# tk-cyberpunk-theme - A Dark Theme For Desktop Apps
The `tk-cyberpunk-theme` is used as base theme in `Hubstore`, `Jupitest`, `Rustiql` and `Hubway`.

`Pyrustic` is shipped with `tk-cyberpunk-theme`, so you don't need to install it.


Install `tk-cyberpunk-theme`:
```bash
pip install tk-cyberpunk-theme
```
